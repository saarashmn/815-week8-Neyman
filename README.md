I couldn't get that 2d plot...
but I managed to introduce that likelihood equation and make a Gaussian distribution function :3
give higher values to the following variables and get a better looking graph:
Nmeas = 100
Nexp  = 100000
bounds = 100
my laptop is too old to process anything beyond that.
